SWIMBA, aka SWIFT-SIMBA, is a re-implementation of the [SIMBA](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/) subgrid model in the [SWIFT](https://swift.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) hydrodynamic code.
Most of SWIMBA's code was written by Drs. Doug Rennehan and Romeel Davé.
SWIMBA has been tuned to match the original SIMBA results as closely as possible.
Original SIMBA is built in the [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html) simulation code, while SWIMBA is built in SWIFT.
The goal is to determine what the difference in simulation code changes does to the results of the simulation.
This project is being undertaken as a part of my PhD at the University of Connecticut, under [Dr. Anglés-Alcázar](https://angles-alcazar.physics.uconn.edu/), and is associated with the [CAMELS collaboration](https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
